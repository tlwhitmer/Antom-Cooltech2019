    <h1 class="team">About Our Team</h1>
    <p class="first">I'm Antonio and with me is my partner Om; we're a part of a team called Antom. The idea of the Aqualizer came across in our head by thinking of the biggest thing going on with Earth, which is water pollution!
   	 We have learned from experience that starting small can lead to something bigger and that is what we did. We came up with a pool light that can detect any dirt or filthy swimming pools with just
   	 the color changing of the light or getting notifications on your phone. My partner and I have both roles in project managing and the concept details because we both love working together than working
   	 alone!</p>

    <p>The deadline for the protype will be done in 5 months tops on June 30th! We will be providing estimated budgets of our product during the first 3 weeks of January and gathering resources for production of the pool light!
   	 Our team has made the estimated time that the construction of the Aqualizer will take time to build as we want our product to be environmental friendly and working smoothly on its release!<p>
